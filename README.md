We've made it through the basics of working with sockets, and now we're ready to try to actually build something with them, so, in this sockets with Python tutorial, we're going to build a console-based chat app.


Client:
A client is a computer that requests the service from the server through a network. In most cases, clients are normal computers, tablets, phones, etc. A client request to the server, and the server gives a response to the client.

Protocols:
The communication (sending and receiving of data packets) between clients and servers follows some rules called protocols. There are two types of protocols that we need in our application

TCP
UDP
TCP: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is reliable as it guarantees the delivery of data packets to the destination.

UDP: User diagram protocol (UDP) on other hand cannot guarantee the successful delivery of data packets.

You can also check more on TCP and UDP here.

Socket:
The socket is a method of communication between the client and the server in a network.

Analogy: If you need a mouth to talk and communicate, so you need a socket to communicate.

A server binds its socket with an address so that different clients can identify it. The socket is made up of two parts

IP Address
Port
A client needs an IP address and port number on which the server is listening to reach the server.

Create a Basic Server and Client in Python.
